## Abstract
This is the final project created by Catherine Zeng for HCDE 410 Human Data Interaction course at the University of Washington. 

In this project, I plan to use a dataset from World Bank Group named “Global Education Statistics" to examine and analyze the differences of pre-primary education access and progression among different countries around the globe. Using the skills I have learned in this course, I will interpret the findings via data wrangling, analysis, and presentation, to highlight interesting, concerning, and/or confusing trends I have discovered in the data via the lens of human-centered data science and data ethics. The project shows that countries from certain part of the world have been paying attentions to pre-primary education. It also shows that most countries show relevant growth pre-primary educational indicators, such as net enrollment rate, which indicate that these countries are increasing their attentions to the young children and the pre-primary education.
