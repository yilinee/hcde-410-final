# hcde-410-final
This is the final project created by Catherine Zeng for HCDE 410 Human Data Interaction course at the University of Washington. 

In this proejct, I plan to use a dataset from World Bank Group named â€œGlobal Education Statistics" to examine and analyze the differences of early childhood educational access and progression among different countries around the globe. Using the skills I have learned in this course, I will interpret the findings via data wrangling, analysis, and presentation, to highlight interesting, concerning, and/or confusing trends I have discovered in the data via the lens of human-centered data science and social ethics.
